Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'web-vitals' in 'C:\Users\e430372\Downloads\react-clock-app1\app\src'

It seems like the web-vitals package is missing from your project. To fix this error, you need to install the web-vitals package. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory (where your package.json file is located).

Run the following command to install the web-vitals package as a development dependency:

sh
npm install --save-dev web-vitals
Restart your development server by running:

sh
npm start

This should resolve the error. If the issue persists, try deleting your node_modules folder and package-lock.json file, then run npm install again to reinstall all dependencies.
